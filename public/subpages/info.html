    <h1><u>info</u></h1>
    <h3>mail system</h3>
    <p class="indent">Type ![mail][recipient][message] to send mail to a user's inbox.</p>
    <p class="indent">Type ![mail] to check your inbox.</p>
    <p class="indent2">Note that anyone can access your inbox and use your username at any time!</p>
    <h3>https</h3>
    <p class="indent">Click <a id="https-chat">here</a> to visit a (hopefully) more secure version of Chat</p>
    <p class="indent2">Note that your browser will probably say the site you are visiting is unsecure, but that is because Chat is not using a verified SSL cerfiticate. The connection will still be encrypted and more secure than if you were not using https. Browsers just like to complain when the SSL certificate is not verified. In the worst case scenario, it should not be any less secure than the connection protocol (http) you use by default when connecting to Chat.</p>
    <h3>miscellaneous commands</h3>
    <p class="indent">Type ![pop][message] to make a copy of the message draggable and exitable.</p>
    <p class="indent2">You can also add a third argument: "[ignoreHtml]" to prevent the associated chat message from rendering the html in your message. This is useful if you want to pop something that auto-plays and you don't want two elements auto-playing at the same time, or if you want to make the source code of the html in your message easily accessible. E.g. ![pop][&lt;strong&gt;Example.&lt;/strong&gt;][ignoreHtml].</p>
    <p class="indent2">Also note that if you use an https connection your browser will probably block a lot of messages that contain html that pulls resources from other sites. You can often times allow insecure content to display on specific pages in your browser settings or you could just use the http connection. Be aware that allowing insecure elements will make the page less secure. (But again, it shouldn't make the page any less secure than if you were using the http connection).</p>
    <p class="indent">Type ![cLog] to see a list of recent user connects and disconnects.</p>
